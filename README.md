This project includes:
* The Python scripts to calculate statistics and create graphics for SLRs from csv and Excel files.
* The notebook with all the graphics and auxiliary datasets generated for our multivocal mapping study about smart contract languages.

Although the scripts have been created for our multivocal mapping study, they can be reused for SLRs in other contexts.
