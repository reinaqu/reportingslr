This project includes:
* The Python scripts to calculate statistics and create graphics for SLRs from csv and Excel files.
* The notebook with all the graphips and auxiliary datasets.
Although the scripts have been created for our multivocal mapping study, they can be reused for SLRs in other contexts.
